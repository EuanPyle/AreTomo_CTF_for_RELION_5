# AreTomo_CTF_for_RELION_5
I generally find CTFFIND doesn't give great CTF estimations for Tomography data whereas AreTomo2 nearly always does. However, currently, CTFFIND is the only way of estimating CTF in RELION 5. 

This script runs the CTF estimation from AreTomo2 on .star files generated by RELION 5 and updates the defocus values. It does not perform or overwrite tilt series alignment.

USE

The input should be a .star file from RELION 5 which resulted from a Tilt Series Alignment job. That's it really...

FUTURE

Currently making this into a small pip package but the script currently on the repo is useable and clear.
